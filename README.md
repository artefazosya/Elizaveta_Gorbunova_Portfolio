## Projects Overview

 ### [08_Food market research](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/artefazosya/yandex-practicum/blob/29903fd8f7591278f731359ba2144c47db3cbe02/09_Mobile_app_conversion.ipynb#goal)
 
 In this project I've worked with data on food market in LA:
 * I counted different types of establishments
 * 
 
**Key words**: sales funnel, conversion, A/B test, user behaviour. **Libraries used**: pandas, plotly, seaborn, scipy.

 ### [09_Mobile_app_conversion](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/artefazosya/yandex-practicum/blob/29903fd8f7591278f731359ba2144c47db3cbe02/09_Mobile_app_conversion.ipynb#goal)
 
 In this project I've analysed logs of a mobile app:
 * I've checked how many logs are there per each date, chose a suitable date interval for analysis
 * Counted user actions and created a sales funnel
 * Gave recommendations on conversion improvement
 * Checked whether there were any statistically significant differences between each group
 * Interpreted the results of the A/A/B experiment
 
**Key words**: sales funnel, conversion, A/B test, user behaviour. **Libraries used**: pandas, plotly, seaborn, scipy.
