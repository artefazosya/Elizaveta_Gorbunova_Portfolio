## [Online store A/B testing](https://github.com/artefazosya/Elizaveta_Gorbunova_Portfolio/blob/main/07_Online_store_AB_testing/07_Online_store_AB_testing.ipynb)
 
 In this project I've worked with data on orders and visits of an online store:
 * I prioritised list of hypotheses to test using ICE and RICE scores
 * Analysed results of A/B test: compared cumulative revenue, order size, conversion rate for each group
 * Detected anomalies in data
 * Checked whether there was statistical significance between groups using data with and without anomalies
 * Provided recommendations 
 
**Key words**: hypotheses prioritization, hypotheses testing, A/B testing

**Libraries used**: pandas, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn

## [Mobile app conversion](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/artefazosya/yandex-practicum/blob/bf518d04cd31bf8bb81d7a34cd361fb2e9eb54bf/09_Mobile_app_conversion/09_Mobile_app_conversion.ipynb)
 
 In this project I've analysed logs of a mobile app to improve conversion and analyze experiment results:
 * I've checked how many logs are there per each date, chose a suitable date interval for analysis
 * Counted user actions and created a sales funnel
 * Gave recommendations on conversion improvement
 * Checked whether there were any statistically significant differences between each group
 * Interpreted the results of the A/A/B experiment
 
**Key words**: sales funnel, conversion, A/B test, user behaviour. 

**Libraries used**: pandas, plotly, seaborn, scipy.

## [Food market research](https://github.com/artefazosya/yandex-practicum/blob/main/08_Food_market_research/08_Food_market_research.ipynb)
 
 In this project I've worked with data on food market in LA to provide recommendations for a new restaurant investors:
 * I counted different types of establishments
 * Found dependencies between type of establishment and belonging to a chain
 * Visualised number of seats distribution
 * Investigated LA streets with a lot of restaurants
 * Formulated recommendations 
 
**Key words**: pie chart, bar plot, scatter plot, distribution plot. 

**Libraries used**: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, plotly, seaborn.
