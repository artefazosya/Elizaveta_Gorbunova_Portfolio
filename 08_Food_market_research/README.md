## Project's goal<a id='goal'></a>
Our clients decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so there is a need to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions, but they need an answer: will the new restaurant be able to maintain success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?

We are going to prepare a market research to understand whether new restaurant will be able to maintain success. 

### We have the following data:
- open-source data on restaurants in LA.
- `object_name` — establishment name
- `chain` — chain establishment (TRUE/FALSE)
- `object_type` — establishment type
- `address` — address
- `number` — number of seats

### We are going to:
- preprocess data, 
- analyze restaurants market, 
- formulate recommendations,
- prepare presentation
